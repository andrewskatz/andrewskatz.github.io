I am an assistant professor in the Department of Engineering Education at Virginia Tech. I lead the Improving Decisions in Engineering Education Agents and Systems (IDEEAS) Lab. 

I completed my PhD in the School of Engineering Education at Purdue University in spring of 2019. 

Before starting my doctoral studies, I taught physics (AP Physics I, AP Physics C Mechanics and E&M) at a high school in Dallas, Texas.
